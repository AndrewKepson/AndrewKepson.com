This is my personal website. It is currently built with Astro and headless WordPress, styled with Tailwind CSS.

Always expecting to spend my career doing some form of writing, I studied English literature in college. Shortly after I learned about content writing and blogging, which seemed like the best way to make money with writing. I quickly became interested in SEO, and began working in the digital marketing industry. I had built some websites and learned web development basics as a child, but interacting with them daily reignited my interest, and I knew I wanted to be building websites, not just optimizing them.

In 2020 I had an opportunity to take part in the full stack coding bootcamp at University of Denver. It was exciting to finally learn how the content I wrote in a Content Management System made it to the front end of a website. The bootcamp was focused on MERN stack web development, and I was attracted to React because of its potential regarding site performance, including Core Web Vitals. My interests in SEO and building websites were merging closer together, and I loved figuring out how to implement technical SEO in the context of a modern website.

As my career progressed I moved into Frontend Development. Now I work as a Software Engineer focused on React, Astro, headless CMS development, and automation.

This website is built with Astro and manages content with headless WordPress. On this blog I enjoy writing about topics in headless WordPress, SEO, Astro development, and automation. I also use it to share portfolio projects in web development. Feel free to get in touch with me using the contact page.
