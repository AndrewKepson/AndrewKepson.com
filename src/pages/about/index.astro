				Over the last decade, I’ve worked at the intersection of design and development — crafting thoughtful
				experiences that align function with philosophy. My projects are built with intention: every line of
				code, every word, every pixel has to belong.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today I lead projects that merge creative storytelling, technical depth, and strategic design systems.
				Whether I’m writing essays on moral design or developing brand ecosystems, the goal remains the same —
				to make clarity visible.
